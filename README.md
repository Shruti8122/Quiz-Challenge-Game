# Quiz Challenge: Single-Page Web App

## üìù Overview

This project is a simple, five-question trivia quiz built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application is implemented as a single HTML page with dynamic content switching, eliminating the need for separate navigation pages.

The quiz tests general knowledge and provides immediate feedback on the final score.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Single-Page Application (SPA) Flow:** Seamless transition between the Start Screen, Quiz Screen, and Results Screen without refreshing the page.

* **Dynamic Question Loading:** JavaScript loads questions and generates answer options dynamically from a structured data array.

* **Score Tracking:** The user's score is updated instantly upon submission of each answer.

* **Responsive Layout:** Designed to look good on various screen sizes (assuming basic Tailwind or flexible CSS is applied).

* **Replayability:** A "Try Again" button on the results screen resets the game state and relaunches the quiz.

## üöÄ Setup and Running the Application

Since this is a client-side application with no backend dependencies, setting up the quiz is very straightforward.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).

### Steps to Run

1. **Save the files:** Ensure you have the following two files saved in the same directory:

   * `index.html` (The combined HTML structure)

   * `script.js` (The core quiz logic)

   * `style.css` (Your custom styles)

2. **Open in Browser:** Simply double-click on the `index.html` file. It will automatically open in your default web browser.
